# Ways to contribute 

### I found a bug the app

Sorry to hear that. Just log a new [GitHub issue](../../issues) and someone will take a look at it. Remember, the more information you provide, the easier it will be to fix the issue. If you feel like it, you can also fix the bug on your own and submit a new pull request.

### I have an idea for a new feature (or feedback on existing functionality)

Everybody loves new features! You can submit a new [feature request](../../issues) or you can code it on your own and [send us a pull request](#submitting-pull-requests). In either case, don't forget to mention what's the use case and what's the expected output.


## Submitting pull requests

Unless you're fixing a typo or creating a test, it's usually a good idea to discuss the feature before you submit a pull request with code changes, so let's start with submitting a new [GitHub issue](../../issues) and discussing the whether it fits the vision of a given project.
You might also read these two blogs posts on contributing code: [Open Source Contribution Etiquette](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html) by Miguel de Icaza and [Don't "Push" Your Pull Requests](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) by Ilya Grigorik. Note that all code submissions will be rigorously reviewed and tested, and only those that meet an high bar for both quality and design/roadmap appropriateness will be merged into the source.


### Example - process of contribution
If not stated otherwise, we use [feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow). 

To start with coding, fork the repository you want to contribute to, create a new branch, and start coding. Once the functionality is [done](#Definition-of-Done), you can submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). 

### Definition of Done
<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="https://i.imgur.com/g82Ohdv.png">

- New/fixed code is covered with tests
- CI can build the code
- All tests are pass
- Documentation is updated (e.g. code examples in README, Wiki pages, etc.)
- Code doesn't contain any secrets (private keys, etc.)
- Commit messages are clear. Please read these articles: [Writing good commit messages](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/Writing-good-commit-messages), [A Note About Git Commit Messages](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html), [On commit messages](https://who-t.blogspot.com/2009/12/on-commit-messages.html)


### Feedback

Your pull request will now go through extensive checks by the subject matter experts on our team. Please be patient. Update your pull request according to feedback until it is approved by one of the Kentico maintainers. After that, one of our team members may adjust the branch you merge into based on the expected release schedule.
